# PPTX creation, editing, and analysis

A `.pptx` is a ZIP archive of XML files. Choose your approach by task:

| Task | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Create** a new deck | Write a `pptxgenjs` script — see gotchas below |
| **Edit** an existing deck, or build from a template | unzip → edit `ppt/slides/slideN.xml` → zip |
| **Read** content | `markitdown deck.pptx` (one block per slide under `<!-- Slide number: N -->` markers) |

## Trusted runtime resources

Call `use_skill(pptx)` first. It returns trusted `runtimeResources` for the
Code-owned validator and renderer. Call `check_skill_dependencies` only for the
capability needed by the current task, then run the returned resource using the
returned managed runtime or exact system executable. Do not infer, search for,
copy, or substitute helper paths from parent folders, adjacent repositories,
user profiles, or old snapshots. If a resource or capability is unavailable,
report that fact instead of installing packages or searching elsewhere.

| Runtime resource | What it does |
|---|---|
| `validate-deck` | Bounded PPTX package, content-type, relationship and slide-XML validation. Run it after every generated or edited deck. |
| `render-pdf` | Bounded LibreOffice PDF render through an isolated profile. Pass the exact LibreOffice executable returned by the `render` dependency check when the resource asks for it. |

## Creating with pptxgenjs — gotchas

`pptxgenjs` is provided by the managed `create` capability. Use the returned managed Node runtime rather than `npm install`; if it is unavailable, report the dependency result. The model knows the API; these are the footguns:

- **Set `pres.layout` before adding slides.** The default canvas is `LAYOUT_16x9` = **10" × 5.625"**, not 13.3" wide. Coordinates past the edge are written, not clamped — the shape just isn't on the slide. (`LAYOUT_WIDE` is 13.3" × 7.5".)
- **Hex colors: never `#`, never 8 digits.** `color: "FF0000"`. Both `"#FF0000"` and alpha baked into the hex (`"00000020"`) **corrupt the file**. For translucency: `transparency: 0-100` on fills and images, `opacity: 0.0-1.0` on shadows — each is silently ignored on the other.
- **pptxgenjs mutates option objects in place** (converts values to EMU on first use). Never share one `shadow`/options object across two `add*` calls — build a fresh object each time.
- **Shadow `offset` must be ≥ 0** — a negative offset corrupts the file. To cast a shadow upward, use `angle: 270` with a positive offset.
- **`letterSpacing` is silently ignored** — the real option is `charSpacing`.
- **Lists:** `bullet: true` on each item, never a literal `•` (renders double bullets). Set `breakLine: true` on every array item except the last. Space bulleted paragraphs with `paraSpaceAfter`, not `lineSpacing` (huge gaps).
- **One `new pptxgen()` per output file** — never reuse an instance.
- **`rectRadius` only works on `ROUNDED_RECTANGLE`**, not `RECTANGLE`.
- **Gradient fills aren't supported** — use a gradient image as the background instead.
- **Text boxes have built-in internal padding** — set `margin: 0` whenever text must align with a shape, line, or icon at the same x.
- **Speaker notes go in `slide.addNotes("...")`** (plain text, once per slide), never in a text box on the slide.
- **Keep charts native.** Use `addChart()` for everything PowerPoint can chart (pass an array of `{type, data, options}` for combos). For PowerPoint-native features the library doesn't expose (trendlines, error bars), compute the extra series yourself or post-process the generated OOXML — do not fall back to a rendered image. Only chart types PowerPoint has no native form for (Sankey, network, chord) go in as images.
- **Default charts render bare** — no title, no data labels, dated palette. Set `showTitle` + `title`, `showValue: true` + `dataLabelPosition`, `chartColors: [...]` from your palette, and quiet the frame (`catAxisLabelColor`/`valAxisLabelColor`, `valGridLine: { color, size }`, `catGridLine: { style: "none" }`, `showLegend: false` for a single series).
- **On a stacked bar or column chart, `dataLabelPosition` must be `ctr`, `inEnd`, or `inBase`.** `outEnd` **corrupts the file**.
- **A combo series using `secondaryValAxis`/`secondaryCatAxis` needs both `valAxes` and `catAxes` on the chart options, two entries each.** Without them pptxgenjs writes axis *ids* it never declares, and PowerPoint **discards that chart** and reports the file as corrupt. Supplying only `valAxes` is not enough.
- **After `writeFile()`, run the returned `validate-deck` runtime resource.** Fix a reported package defect in the generator, not by hand-editing the packed XML.
- **Never reorder the children of `<p:presentation>`.** pptxgenjs writes `<p:notesMasterIdLst>` right after `<p:sldIdLst>` and points both masters at one theme part. PowerPoint reads that happily — move the element and the same deck becomes unopenable.
- **Icons:** render `react-icons` to SVG (`ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup`), rasterize with `sharp` at ≥256px, and insert via `addImage({ data: "image/png;base64," + buf.toString("base64") })` — the `image/png;base64,` prefix is required. Use only dependencies reported ready by `check_skill_dependencies`; do not install packages from a presentation task.

## Editing existing decks and templates

Use `markitdown` to map each content section onto a template slide, then render an explicit project copy through the returned `render-pdf` resource before changing the source deck. Do not search for slide-copy, cleanup, thumbnail, schema, or office helper scripts; only use a returned runtime resource or an explicitly available managed dependency.

- **Do all structural work — add, delete, reorder — before editing any slide's content.** Keep a template-derived output separate from the original and validate the output after every structural batch.
- **Never copy a slide file by hand.** A slide also references layouts, charts, SmartArt, media and embedded objects; use a library or explicitly reviewed OOXML operation that preserves the package registrations.
- **If you use `python-pptx`**, three things it won't do: duplicate a slide (its only entry point is `add_slide(layout)`), preserve formatting through `text_frame.text = "..."` (that collapses the paragraph to a single unstyled run — assign `run.text` instead), or read the SVG/EMF most template art uses (`add_picture` raises `UnidentifiedImageError`).
- Legacy `.ppt` conversion and `.potx` editing require an explicitly supported capability. Do not guess a converter path; report an unavailable capability rather than substituting a system command.
- To reuse a template icon or image, duplicate a slide or layout that already contains it.

When filling in a template:

- If you script an XML transform, parse with `defusedxml.minidom` — round-tripping OOXML through `xml.etree.ElementTree` rewrites namespace prefixes and corrupts the deck.
- **Template slots ≠ source items.** If the template shows 4 team members and you have 3, delete the 4th member's entire group (image + text boxes), not just its text — then check for orphaned visuals in QA.
- One `<a:p>` per list item — never concatenate items into a single paragraph. Copy the sibling `<a:pPr>` to preserve spacing, and put `b="1"` on the `<a:rPr>` of titles, section headers, and inline labels (`Status:`, `Owner:`).
- Let bullets inherit from the layout; only add `<a:buChar>`, `<a:buAutoNum>` (numbered), or `<a:buNone>` to override — never a literal `•` in the text.
- Text with leading or trailing spaces needs `xml:space="preserve"` on its `<a:t>`.

## Design Ideas

**Don't create boring slides.** Plain bullets on a white background won't impress anyone. Consider ideas from this list for each slide.

### Before Starting

- **Pick a bold, content-informed color palette**: The palette should feel designed for THIS topic. If swapping your colors into a completely different presentation would still "work," you haven't made specific enough choices.
- **Dominance over equality**: One color should dominate (60-70% visual weight), with 1-2 supporting tones and one sharp accent. Never give all colors equal weight.
- **Dark/light contrast**: Dark backgrounds for title + conclusion slides, light for content ("sandwich" structure). Or commit to dark throughout for a premium feel.
- **Commit to a visual motif**: Pick ONE distinctive element and repeat it — rounded image frames, icons in colored circles. Carry it across every slide. **Do not use a color bar or accent stripe as your motif** (see Avoid list).

### Color Palettes

Choose colors that match your topic — don't default to generic blue. Use these palettes as inspiration:

| Theme | Primary | Secondary | Accent |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Midnight Executive** | `1E2761` (navy) | `CADCFC` (ice blue) | `FFFFFF` (white) |
| **Forest & Moss** | `2C5F2D` (forest) | `97BC62` (moss) | `F5F5F5` (cream) |
| **Coral Energy** | `F96167` (coral) | `F9E795` (gold) | `2F3C7E` (navy) |
| **Warm Terracotta** | `B85042` (terracotta) | `E7E8D1` (sand) | `A7BEAE` (sage) |
| **Ocean Gradient** | `065A82` (deep blue) | `1C7293` (teal) | `21295C` (midnight) |
| **Charcoal Minimal** | `36454F` (charcoal) | `F2F2F2` (off-white) | `212121` (black) |
| **Teal Trust** | `028090` (teal) | `00A896` (seafoam) | `02C39A` (mint) |
| **Berry & Cream** | `6D2E46` (berry) | `A26769` (dusty rose) | `ECE2D0` (cream) |
| **Sage Calm** | `84B59F` (sage) | `69A297` (eucalyptus) | `50808E` (slate) |
| **Cherry Bold** | `990011` (cherry) | `FCF6F5` (off-white) | `2F3C7E` (navy) |

### For Each Slide

**Every slide needs a visual element** — image, chart, icon, or shape. Text-only slides are forgettable.

**Layout options:**
- Two-column (text left, illustration on right)
- Icon + text rows (icon in colored circle, bold header, description below)
- 2x2 or 2x3 grid (image on one side, grid of content blocks on other)
- Half-bleed image (full left or right side) with content overlay

**Data display:**
- Large stat callouts (big numbers 60-72pt with small labels below)
- Comparison columns (before/after, pros/cons, side-by-side options)
- Timeline or process flow (numbered steps, arrows)

**Visual polish:**
- Icons in small colored circles next to section headers
- Italic accent text for key stats or taglines

### Typography

**Font names you write into the .pptx are rendered by the user's PowerPoint, not by this environment.** Your visual QA renders via LibreOffice, which substitutes fonts it doesn't have — and for some fonts the substitute has different widths, so your QA preview can show text overflow (or fit) that the real deck won't have. To keep your QA trustworthy:

- **Safe fonts** (render true-to-width in QA *and* ship with Office): **Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Times New Roman, Courier New, Bookman Old Style, Century Schoolbook**. Use these for body text and anything where fit matters.
- **Headers with personality at zero QA risk**: pair a safe-list serif header (Cambria, Bookman Old Style, Century Schoolbook) with a safe-list sans body (Calibri or Arial). You get visual contrast without giving up reliable overflow checks.
- **If the user asks for a font outside the safe list** (e.g. Georgia or Trebuchet MS): use it where the user asked, but size those containers with extra slack (~10%) and don't trust QA text-fit on those elements — the preview of that font is approximate. If the user hasn't specified, prefer safe-list fonts for body text.
- **QA-unreliable fonts** (substitute has different widths — overflow checks can be wrong): Georgia, Trebuchet MS, Impact, Arial Black, Garamond, Consolas, Palatino Linotype. Calibri Light substitution varies by environment; treat as QA-unreliable. Fine for titles/accents with slack; don't trust QA text-fit on these.
- **Never default to Aptos** — Office's post-2023 default has no metric-compatible substitute here *and* is missing from older Office installs, so it's unreliable on both ends.

| Element | Size |
|---------|------|
| Slide title | 36-44pt bold |
| Section header | 20-24pt bold |
| Body text | 14-16pt |
| Captions | 10-12pt muted |

### Spacing

- 0.5" minimum margins
- 0.3-0.5" between content blocks
- Leave breathing room—don't fill every inch

### Avoid (Common Mistakes)

- **Don't repeat the same layout** — vary columns, cards, and callouts across slides
- **Don't center body text** — left-align paragraphs and lists; center only titles
- **Don't skimp on size contrast** — titles need 36pt+ to stand out from 14-16pt body
- **Don't default to blue** — pick colors that reflect the specific topic
- **Don't mix spacing randomly** — choose 0.3" or 0.5" gaps and use consistently
- **Don't style one slide and leave the rest plain** — commit fully or keep it simple throughout
- **Don't create text-only slides** — add images, icons, charts, or visual elements; avoid plain title + bullets
- **Don't forget text box padding** — when aligning lines or shapes with text edges, set `margin: 0` on the text box or offset the shape to account for padding
- **Don't use low-contrast elements** — icons AND text need strong contrast against the background; avoid light text on light backgrounds or dark text on dark backgrounds
- **NEVER use accent lines under titles** — these are a hallmark of AI-generated slides; use whitespace or background color instead
- **NEVER add decorative color bars or accent stripes** — this includes: header/footer bars spanning the slide width, vertical sidebar stripes down one edge of the slide, thin accent stripes along one edge of a card or content block, and "single-side borders" on rectangles. These read as AI-generated filler. If you want to set a card apart, use a subtle background tint, a drop shadow, or an icon — not an edge stripe.
- **Don't default to cream/beige backgrounds** — when no background is specified, use white (`FFFFFF`) or the user's brand palette; avoid warm-neutral defaults like `F5F5DC`, `FAF0E6`, `FAEBD7`, `FFF8E1`
- **Don't ship text that overflows its shape** — if text doesn't fit, reduce font size, split across slides, or enlarge the container; never leave content cut off or spilling past bounds

## QA (Required)

Your first render usually has a few real issues — overlaps, overflow, misalignment. Find and fix those, re-render only the slides you changed, and stop.

### Content QA

```bash
markitdown output.pptx
```

Check for missing content, typos, wrong order.

**When using templates, check for leftover placeholder text:**

```bash
markitdown output.pptx | grep -iE "\bx{3,}\b|lorem|ipsum|\bTODO|\[insert|this.*(page|slide).*layout"
```

If grep returns results, fix them before declaring success.

### File QA (required)

```bash
"<dependency Python>" "<runtimeResources validate-deck path>" output.pptx
```

Validate the final output, including a template-derived output, before delivery. The bounded Code validator checks package structure, required presentation parts and slide XML; a successful result does not replace visual QA. Fix defects in the generator or reviewed edit operation, then rebuild.

### Visual QA

Render the deck through the returned `render-pdf` resource and inspect the resulting images independently of the generating code. User-visible defects to look for:

- **Text overflow or text cut off at a box or slide boundary — check this first.** It is the most common defect and always user-visible. (For a font the previewer renders unreliably per Typography, the preview is approximate: trust the ~10% slack you left, not its apparent fit.)
- Overlapping elements (text through shapes, lines through words, stacked elements)
- Source citations or footers colliding with content above
- Elements too close (< 0.3" gaps) or cards/sections nearly touching
- Uneven gaps (large empty area in one place, cramped in another)
- Insufficient margin from slide edges (< 0.5")
- Columns or similar elements not aligned consistently
- Low-contrast text (e.g., light gray text on cream-colored background)
- Template decoration mispositioned after text replacement — e.g., a title underline positioned for one line, but the replaced title wrapped to two
- Low-contrast icons (e.g., dark icons on dark backgrounds without a contrasting circle)
- Text boxes too narrow causing excessive wrapping
- Leftover placeholder content

## Converting to Images

Convert presentations to individual slide images for visual inspection:

```bash
"<dependency Python>" "<runtimeResources render-pdf path>" output.pptx qa-output --soffice "<exact LibreOffice executable>"
"<exact pdftoppm executable>" -jpeg -r 150 qa-output/output.jpg slide
```

Pass only exact paths returned by the dependency check and runtime resource contract. Keep QA outputs in a task-owned output directory.

After a fix, rerender the PDF before inspecting images again.

## Dependencies

`pptxgenjs` (managed Node) · `markitdown[pptx]`, `Pillow`, `defusedxml`, `lxml` (managed Python) · LibreOffice (`soffice`, user-installed system dependency verified as a real LibreOffice installation) · `pdftoppm` (managed/system dependency reported by the `render` check)
